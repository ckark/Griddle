# Overview

With griddle, you can organize any number of selected elements into a grid:

1. Select the element you want to include in the grid.
2. Specify the number of columns in the grid.
3. Enter the gap size between columns and rows (in pixels).
4. You've made a grid!

# Notes

-   Don't feel constrained by the suggestions; feel free to specify any number of columns and any gap size you want. Just make sure both values are a number.
-   Nodes are sorted numerically and alphabetically prior to making the grid. Since the plugin uses JavaScript's native `sort()` and `localeCompare()` methods, behavior may not always be predictible.

# Roadmap

Based on feedback, I'm planning to add options to sort elements before placing them in a grid.
